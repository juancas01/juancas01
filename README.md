# 👋 Hi, I'm Juan Manuel Castillo!

🎓 I’m an undergrad student of **International Business and Industrial Engineering** at **Universidad de La Sabana**, with a minor in **Data Science**.  

💡 Recently, I discovered my real passion lies in **Computer Science**, **Data Science**, and **Artificial Intelligence**.  

🌱 So I’m eager to learn, grow, and contribute to these fields.
